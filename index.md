# Welcome to my ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

This is where the self-assessmet will go.

## Artifact One

### Enhancement 

### Narrative

The artifact which was enhanced in this section is part of the CS 340 Final Project from the CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This part of the final project is a program, written in Python, which allows a user to interact with a database. The enhancement that I will perform on this program for this section of the ePortfolio is to translate the program into a different coding language: Java. This will demonstrate my ability to achieve the same goals via various means, and it will show my capabilities in multiple programming languages.

So far, I have successfully rewritten the program in Java. I am currently entering the debugging phase, and during this time I will also add more comments to the code and make the functions more consistent with one another. I faced a few different challenges while performing this enhancement. One challenge I encountered was having to refresh my knowledge of Java and MongoDB, as I had not worked with these things in several months. Another challenge I encountered was how differently some aspects of the program needed to be written to work; while I had the Python program to reference, of course, I felt almost as though I were writing the Java program from scratch. Since I have never worked with languages side-by-side like this, I did not realize how different they truly were. This was quite an eye-opening experience.


## Artifact Two

### Enhancement

### Narrative

   The artifact chosen for the algorithms and data structure portion of the ePortfolio is the CS 340 Final Project from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This artifact is a program, written in Python, which allows a user to interact with a database. According to the rubric for the project, a user can insert a document into the database, update a document, delete a document, and search for documents in a few ways. I selected this item to demonstrate my ability to use algorithms to create an easy program that a user could interact with, even if they had limited computer experience. I improved this artifact by broadening the program to allow the user to interact with the database with more flexibility. For example, a user can now update any value in a document, whereas before they could only update the “Volume” value; along these lines, a user can now delete a key-value pair if they so desire. Also, a user now has a variety of ways they can search for documents, whereas the original program had a few specific ways they could search.

The course objective that I planned to meet is CS-499-03. I believe that in expanding on the complexity of the artifact I have achieved that goal. I would also like to improve upon the security of the program, since the program does not yet check some user inputs that certainly should be checked. This would be an update to the course objectives I would like to achieve, adding CS-499-05 as a goal. As I was working on this enhancement, I learned how to think like a user. This is something that I haven’t yet had much experience in, but my broader goal in this case was to try to create a program that a user would be able to use to navigate their database. Therefore, I tried to consider what functionalities a user might need. This is certainly a change from trying to fulfill the requirements set forth by a rubric.

## Artifact Threee

### Enhancement

### Narrative

The artifact chosen for the databases portion of the ePortfolio is the final project from the CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course. This artifact is a program that allows a user to interact with a database. During the first two portions of the ePortfolio, I first translated the program from Python into Java, and then I expanded upon the original scope of the program. Finally, this portion will represent the program as a full stack application, written in JavaScript. This artifact will be included in the ePortfolio because it will display my ability to learn new skills on the fly, since I have never written a program like this before, nor have I written in JavaScript. It will also demonstrate my ability to work with new database platforms, since this app accesses MongoDB from the cloud.

I developed the app using a tutorial called “Let’s build a full stack MongoDB, React, Node and Express (MERN) app” written by Jelo Rivera (2018). This allowed me to grasp the basic concepts of the app, and from here I will try to make the app more specific to the chosen artifact. The app is currently only accessible locally (to my understanding), so I will also attempt to make the app more widely accessible, since the app currently launches from the Node.js command prompt and opens in a browser window. This artifact proved to be challenging in that I had to learn a new set of skills and concepts in a short amount of time; I had never considered developing an app until this project.
