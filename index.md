## Professional Self-Assessment



## Code Review

## Software Design and Engineering

### Narrative

   The artifact which was enhanced in this section is part of the CS 340 Final Project from the SNHU course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This part of the final project is a program, written in Python, which allows a user to interact with a database. The enhancement that I will perform on this program for this section of the ePortfolio is to translate the program into a different coding language: Java. This will demonstrate my ability to achieve specific goals via various means, and it will show my capabilities in multiple programming languages.

   I faced a few different challenges while performing this enhancement. One challenge I encountered was having to refresh my knowledge of Java and MongoDB, as I had not worked with these things in several months. Another challenge I encountered was how differently some aspects of the program needed to be written to work; while I had the Python program to reference, of course, I felt almost as though I were writing the Java program from scratch. Since I have never worked with languages side-by-side like this, I did not realize how different they truly were.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Narrative

   The artifact chosen for the algorithms and data structure portion of the ePortfolio is the CS 340 Final Project from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This artifact is a program, written in Python, which allows a user to interact with a database. According to the rubric for the project, a user can insert a document into the database, update a document, delete a document, and search for documents in a few ways. I selected this item to demonstrate my ability to use algorithms to create an program that a user could easily interact with, even if they had limited computer experience. I improved this artifact by broadening the program to allow the user to interact with the database with more flexibility. For example, a user can now update any value in a document, whereas before they could only update the “Volume” value; along these lines, a user can now delete a key-value pair if they so desire. Also, a user now has a variety of ways they can search for documents, whereas the original program had a few specific ways they could search.

   As I was working on this enhancement, I learned how to think like a user. This is something that I have not yet had much experience in, but my broader goal in this case was to try to create a program that a user would be able to use to navigate their database. Therefore, I tried to consider what functionalities a user might need. This is certainly a change from trying to fulfill the requirements set forth by a rubric. I also began to be more security conscious; while I was aware of threats such as SQL-injections, I did not know whether MongoDB was vulnerable in the same way. I had to think not just as a user, but as a bad actor. One way to protect against NoSQL injections is to ensure that all input is converted to a string, which is ensured by using "raw_input" to accept user input (Zanon, 2016; Chinchilla, 2017).

## Databases

### Narrative

   The artifact chosen for the databases portion of the ePortfolio is the final project from the CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course. This artifact is a program that allows a user to interact with a database. During the first two portions of the ePortfolio, I first translated the program from Python into Java, and then I expanded upon the original scope of the program. Finally, this portion will represent the program as a full stack application, written in JavaScript. This artifact will be included in the ePortfolio because it will display my ability to learn new skills on the fly, since I have never written a program like this before, nor have I written in JavaScript. It will also demonstrate my ability to work with new database platforms, since this app accesses MongoDB from the cloud.

   I developed the app using a tutorial called “Let’s build a full stack MongoDB, React, Node and Express (MERN) app” written by Jelo Rivera (2018). This allowed me to grasp the basic concepts of the app, and from here I will try to make the app more specific to the chosen artifact. The app is currently only accessible locally. This artifact proved to be challenging in that I had to learn a new set of skills and concepts in a short amount of time; I had never considered developing an app until this project. The next step in app development would be to host the app so that it can be more widely available.
