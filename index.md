# Welcome to my ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

   As I worked through the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I developed a very powerful and versatile set of skills. Some courses were very technical and focused on the specifics of languages and computer programming. Others were geared towards succeeding in a workplace and highlighted project management and team cooperation. While it is important, of course, to understand the technical aspects of computer science, the more abstract concepts are just as valuable. For example, in a software development lifecycle course, I learned about project development, agile versus waterfall development styles, and how to interact with  coworkers, customers, and supervisors throughout a project. Being able to communicate with a stakeholder or function on a software development team is just as important as knowing Python, Java, or C++. Having this foundation, I strongly believe I will thrive in a team environment. These skills will certainly be beneficial as I work towards my goal of becoming a cybersecurity professional, since I will have both a technical and professional understanding of the computer science field.

   The following three artifacts are based on one final project I completed earlier on in my college career: the final project for the CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts course. This program allows a user to interact with a database, with full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) capabilities. This project is able to demonstrate many things at once: the program provides a platform to demonstrate my proficiency in multiple languages, shows I can make proper use of data structures to create an efficient interface, and provides a basis for the development of a full-stack application.
 
## Code Review

[Click here](https://youtu.be/FqF6p_0CEmE) to access the code review video, which is hosted on YouTube. This code review analyses the existing functionality of the code, assesses the code structure and best practices, and identifies potential enhancements to be made to the code.

## Software Design and Engineering

### Narrative

   The enhancement that I will perform on this program for this section of the ePortfolio is to translate the CS340 Final Project into a different coding language: Java. This will demonstrate my ability to achieve specific goals via various means, and it will show my capabilities in multiple programming languages.

   I faced a few different challenges while performing this enhancement. One challenge I encountered was having to refresh my knowledge of Java and MongoDB, as I had not worked with these things in several months. Another challenge I encountered was how differently some aspects of the program needed to be written to work; while I had the Python program to reference, of course, I felt almost as though I were writing the Java program from scratch. Since I have never worked with languages side-by-side like this, I did not realize how different they truly were.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Narrative

   For this section of the ePortfolio, I will expand upon the CS:340 Final Project. According to the rubric for the project, a user can insert a document into the database, update a document, delete a document, and search for documents in a few ways. I selected this item to demonstrate my ability to use algorithms to create a program that a user could easily interact with, even if they had limited computer experience. I improved this artifact by broadening the program to allow the user to interact with the database with more flexibility. For example, a user can now update any value in a document, whereas before they could only update the “Volume” value; along these lines, a user can now delete a key-value pair if they so desire. Also, a user now has a variety of ways they can search for documents, whereas the original program had a few specific ways they could search.

   As I was working on this enhancement, I learned how to think like a user. This is something that I have not yet had much experience in, but my broader goal in this case was to try to create a program that a user would be able to use to navigate their database. Therefore, I tried to consider what functionalities a user might need. This is certainly a change from trying to fulfill the requirements set forth by a rubric. I also began to be more security conscious; while I was aware of threats such as SQL-injections, I did not know whether MongoDB was vulnerable in the same way. I had to think not just as a user, but as a bad actor. One way to protect against NoSQL injections is to ensure that all input is converted to a string, which is ensured by using "raw_input" to accept user input (Zanon, 2016; Chinchilla, 2017).

## Databases

### Narrative

   During the first two portions of the ePortfolio, I first translated the CS340 Final Project from Python into Java, and then I expanded upon the original scope of the program. Finally, this portion will represent the program as a full stack application, written in JavaScript. This artifact will be included in the ePortfolio because it will display my ability to learn new skills on the fly, since I have never written a program like this before, nor have I written in JavaScript. It will also demonstrate my ability to work with new database platforms, since this app accesses MongoDB from the cloud.

   I developed the app using a tutorial called “Let’s build a full stack MongoDB, React, Node and Express (MERN) app” written by Jelo Rivera (2018). This allowed me to grasp the basic concepts of the app, and from here I will try to make the app more specific to the chosen artifact. The app is currently only accessible locally. This artifact proved to be challenging in that I had to learn a new set of skills and concepts in a short amount of time; I had never considered developing an app until this project. The next step in app development would be to host the app so that it can be more widely available.
